# Challenge Description:
# If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. 
# The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

# Test Case: 3 + 5 + 6 + 9 = 23

# Your Code Here:

tibble(num = seq(1,1000,1)) %>% 
  filter(num %% 3 == 0 | num %% 5 == 0) %>% 
  {sum(.$num)}



# Answer: 234168
