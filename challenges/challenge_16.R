# Challenge 16 - "PDF Extraction"
# 20 Points + 10 Bonus Points

# Challenge Description:
# Many times in the real world, data does not come in nice and neat packages.
# No longer do you need to throw your computer out the window when you find out the data you need is locked in PDF file.
# R has the power to scrape data from PDF files, but it comes with a price.
# Unlike html, PDF's don't have tags that make the document organized beneath a style sheet.
# Your challenge is to scrape and recreate the table as is from the PDF of your input data. 

# Bonus: Find a more efficient way to complete this challenge than I did.

# Hint: library(pdftools), library(stringr), library(purrr) can be helpful friends in this journey.
