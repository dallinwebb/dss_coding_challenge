# BYU-Idaho Data Science Society Coding Challenge

## Are you a true codeR?

So here's the deal. I still have a bunch of StackOverflow merchandize that I need to give away and thought that this could be a good opportunity to not only practice your R coding, but also earn some cool prizes at the same time. Given that it's currently the 7 week break, I didn't want to restrict this challenge to only people who are still around in Rexburg. __Anybody can play the game!__ Here are the directions:

## Directions

1. Fork this repository over to your own personal github account.
2. Notify me (Dylan McDowell), and I will add an issue to your repo that will help you keep track of the challenges you have completed.
3. Work through the challenges and whenever you solve one, push your code to your repository. 
4. Continue playing ad naseua and earn a bunch of cool prizes (limited quantity so particpate quickly)!

## Tips & Tricks

1. These challenges are designed to help illustrate the things R does well. As you go along, you will start to develop a sense of what that means and use that to your advantage. 
2. Therefore, most of theses challenges can be solved in just a few lines of code. If you find yourself with a large rat's nest of for-loops and if statements, take a moment and refer back to tip 1. 
3. These challenges are also designed to get you to utilize the resources available to you. This means I have tried to minimize the discussion that begins each problem. Use this to your advantage, there is a right answer but how you get that answer is up to you. 
4. Reuse your code, as you go along you will find opportunity to reuse code which will help you commit to memory certain functions and frameworks. 
5. These challenges run the gambit from extremely easy to insanely difficult. Don't get frustrated, these are merely opportunities to gain new skills. 

## Additional Info

Currently, these problems are designed to be solved using the R programming language, but they are flexible enough to be solved using any language you desire. For example, if you wish to do these challenges in Python, all you need to do is save the `challenge_*.R` files as `challenge_*.py` files. 

Points are rewarded based on the difficulty of the problem. You can amass these points to "purchase" prizes and merchandize. These problems can be solved using any method you desire (short of just typing the answer). Bonus points will be awarded to those who solve the problems using traditional R semantics (ie vectorization over for-loops).

Once you have solved the problem and pushed the solution to your repository, please notify me and I will award you the proper points after verifying your solution. If you decide to purchase anything with your points, I will record your name down and either *a)* if you're local you can swing by and pick it up, or *b)* I will reserve your prize until you are able to pick it up when you return. 

Given the public nature of the challenge, it is paramount that we all abide by a strict honor system. Many of these problems have solutions that can be found online. Please refrain from sharing blatant solutions or merely copying and pasting code. Professional collaboration is encouraged but I reserve the right to withold points if I believe you cannot explain the code. 

Through my research it appears that while these problems are popular coding challenges throughout the web, there is little documentation showing examples done in R. This is a great opportunity to really learn the basics and nuances of the R language. The whole internet can be your resource (remember no cheating!) and if you approach these problems through an "R Lense" your experience will be invaluable. 

If you come across any errors or have suggestions to clarify certain problems. Please open up an issue on my original repository and I can make those changes.
